                <h2>Do video games actually help with hand-eye coordination?</h2>
                <p> On a certain level, this makes perfect sense. People playing video games need to exercise their 
                    hand-eye coordination all the time — so it would seem to be a given that their hand-eye coordination
                    would improve. But there have been arguments about whether video games really improve hand-eye coordination, 
                    or if they might just reveal someone's talents that are already there. Others argue that those who play video 
                    games may just be better at the type of tests given to determine hand-eye coordination, while still other 
                    studies indicate that there may be a "window of time" during which hand-eye coordination can be improved.
                    <br><br>The actual truth may have to do with a number of environmental factors.

                <h2>Games may not actually improve hand-eye coordinations</h2>
                <p>In a study called The Cognitive Neuroscience of Video Games, Professor C. Shawn Green and neuroscientist Daphne Bavelier 
                    pointed out that while it's intuitive that video games would improve hand-eye coordination, most training in 
                    visual acuity tasks only leads to an improvement in the performance in that specific task.

                    <br><br> other words, when you play Call of Duty, you get better at video games, not general motor function.
                    
                    <br><br>In 2006, a study at the University of Wisconsin found that action video games did not improve the reaction time or hand-eye coordination of college football players. Previous studies had found minor improvements, but no significant differences. 
                    
                    <br><br>In another study, 31 gamers were compared with 31 non-gamers for pursuit rotor tasks. Gamers were seen to have better eye-hand motor coordination on a pursuit rotor. (A pursuit rotor is a type of visual motor tracking that requires someone to follow an object with a cursor.) The amount of time spent gaming and the length of experience with video games did not seem to affect how well each individual performed. In other words, it seemed more likely that familiarity with this type of hand-eye tracking may have been the distinguishing factor.
